/*
1. Why is the ball offset from the mouse? Test different size balls and different positions. How can you fix it so that the mouse is at the centre of the ball? Write a function to calculate the correct position and/or to adjust the position.

2. What other kinds of interaction can you create using this basic setup? Which of those require writing a new event handler? Which don't? Try implementing one or two!

3. Using the template, create a version of the program where the size of the ball increases as you move the mouse horizontally.
